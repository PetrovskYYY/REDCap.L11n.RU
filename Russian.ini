Statistical analysis packages can provide much more robust and precise calculation methods, and can handle a wider variety of calculation functions than can REDCap. Also, the method by which REDCap performs calculations (using JavaScript, a common technology found in all web browsers) is known in rare cases to have calculation precision issues (e.g., the result of a complex calculation should be 0.06 but instead results as 0.06000000000000000005).

For example, if we have a survey question that asks 'What is your first name?', in which the variable name for that question is 'first_name', then the following question may be set up as <b>'[first_name], what is your date of birth?'</b>. If the user entered 'John' as their first name, then text for the next question would literally read as <b>'John, what is your date of birth?'</b>. In the same way, you could use [first_name] in your survey's survey completion text when the survey is completed, in which <b>'Thanks for taking our survey, [first_name]!'</b> would be displayed to the respondent as <b>'Thanks for taking our survey, John!'</b>."

For example, it looks like (this OR this OR this) AND (this OR this OR this), in which all the ORs inside the parentheses are evaluated first and then those groups of ORs are then evaluated together using ANDs."

The filter logic is essentially the same kind of syntax as Branching Logic and Calculated field equations, in which you may use all the special functions, such as if(), datediff(), and various mathematical functions, in your filtering logic. REDCap will double check your hand-typed logic for any syntax errors, and it will not allow you to save the report until all errors have been resolved. When using the Advanced Logic, just make sure that your logic ultimately evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE and that it does *not* evaluate to a value, such as a number.

In other words, if a user was not given form-level access to a particular data collection instrument, then they will still not be able to view data from that instrument inside any report. The same goes if the user is assigned to a Data Access Group, in which case they will still only be able to view data from records in their own DAG. So even though a user may have 'Add/Edit Reports' privileges and may thus be able to view reports to which they have not been given explicit access, they will not be able to view data to which they do not already have access. So implementing user access for a report is not quite the same as setting someone's user privileges. Reports merely act as a window, so to speak, for viewing a subset of the data to which a user has access, in which user privileges are employed when viewing a report. But user access controls for a report merely provide a way to display the reports on certain users' left-hand project menu and thus are different from setting a user's user rights."

ws_40 = "The DDP has the ability to fetch data from the external source system both manually in real time and automatically at a regular interval. The DDP can only import external data for records that already exist in the REDCap project, in which it assumes that a record identifier (e.g. medical record number) is stored within each REDCap record so that the DDP can connect the REDCap record to a record from the source system. Once REDCap has a record identifier value for a given record, it will then go and immediately retrieve the data from the source system in real time, and later it will also check the source system at regular intervals for any additional data."

ws_42 = "Enabling the DDP"
ws_43 = "After being granted access to the DDP, the user will then see the DDP step on the Project Setup page where they can navigate to the DDP mapping/setup page, which allows the user to map fields already created in their REDCap project to fields from the external source system. This mapping allows REDCap to know how where to put the data when importing it from the external system."
ws_44 = "The field mapping process"
ws_45 = "A user on the DDP mapping/setup page can choose any available fields from the external source system to map to one of their REDCap project fields. (Note: This assumes that the user has already created their data collection instruments and fields in their project.) There are two types of fields that may be mapped: 1) one-time data fields, and 2) temporal data fields. One-time data fields are those where data will only be stored one time in the source system, such as demography data. Conversely, temporal data fields are those where data may be collected many times over a period of time (e.g., labs, vitals, any kind of longitudinal data). When mapping temporal fields, you must also specify a REDCap date/datetime field that will be used for determining the window of time in which the DDP should look when fetching data from the source system. It will determine the window of time in conjunction with the day offset value defined on the mapping page. For example, if the value of the mapped REDCap date/datetime field is 2001-11-29 and the day offset is 1 day, it will query the source system and return only data saved for the field from 2001-11-28 until 2001-11-30. Any source data outside of that range will be ignored during the adjudication process. It is important to note that the source data for a temporal field will NOT be fetched from the external source system UNLESS its associated REDCap date/datetime field has a value. Once a value is entered for the associated date/datetime field, source data will then be fetched for that temporal field."
ws_46 = "Preview fields (optional)"
ws_47 = "On the mapping/setup page, you may choose up to 5 source fields to be used as 'preview fields'. Preview fields are optional and are typically used to confirm that the record identifier (e.g. medical record number) that was entered is correct by displaying other contextual data from the source system. For example, if you have 'last name' and 'date of birth' as source fields, you may choose them to be preview fields in your project, and thus when a value is entered in REDCap as the record identifier, if will then fetch and display the last name and date of birth of the person to validate their identity. If preview fields are not utilized, it is possible that incorrect source data is imported. Thus preview fields are not required but are recommended for data quality purposes."
